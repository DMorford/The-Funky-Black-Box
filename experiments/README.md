# ðŸ§ª Experiments

This is the wild west of The Funky Black Box - where ideas get tested, prototypes get built, and things either work brilliantly or explode spectacularly.

## What Goes Here
- Proof of concept code
- Quick tests and prototypes  
- Half-baked ideas worth exploring
- "What if we tried..." projects
- Learning experiments

## Rules
- No guarantees anything here works
- Code quality: "good enough to test"
- Document your findings (even if it fails)
- Move successful experiments to `active/` when ready

## Structure
```
experiments/
â”œâ”€â”€ language-tests/     # New programming languages/frameworks
â”œâ”€â”€ ai-experiments/     # AI/ML testing ground
â”œâ”€â”€ automation/         # Process automation prototypes
â””â”€â”€ misc/              # Everything else
```

**Remember:** This is a sandbox - break things, learn stuff, have fun! ðŸš€
