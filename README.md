## 🎯 What's In The Box?
The Funky Black Box has evolved into a **unified development environment** - your master stash for anything that keeps our development world spinning. It's part emergency kit, part daily driver toolbox, part project orchestrator, and all groove.

### 🛠 What Goes In Here?
- **Emergency Scripts** – recovery/diagnostics for "oh crap" moments
- **Development Projects** – organized active, archived, and experimental work
- **Automation Tools** – scripts, aliases, and commands we use constantly
- **Config Templates** – project setups, .env examples, protection rules
- **Collaboration Framework** – AI-human development workflows
- **Special Assets** – things so valuable we'd cry if they vanished
