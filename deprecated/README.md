# 📦 Deprecated

The digital attic - stuff we're not using anymore but might need someday.

## What Goes Here
- Old project versions
- Deprecated tools/scripts
- Superseded implementations
- "Just in case" backups
- Historical references

## Rules
- Include a deprecation note explaining why it was moved here
- Add the date it was deprecated
- Reference what replaced it (if applicable)
- Don't just dump stuff - organize it

## Structure
```
deprecated/
├── projects/       # Old project versions
├── scripts/        # Superseded scripts
├── configs/        # Old configuration files
└── archive/        # General archive

**Philosophy:** Don't delete - deprecate. You never know when you'll need to reference the old way of doing things! 🗃️
