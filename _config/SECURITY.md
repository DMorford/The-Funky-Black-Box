# Security Configuration and Best Practices

## üîí Security Features

### Configuration Validation
- Environment variables are validated on startup
- Paths are sanitized and checked for directory traversal
- File extensions and types are restricted
- Size limits are enforced for backups and uploads

### Path Security
- All paths are validated against root directory
- No absolute paths allowed in scripts
- Directory traversal protection
- Whitelist-based file extension filtering

### Environment Variables
Required variables:
- `DEVPROJECTS_ROOT`: Base directory for all projects
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub authentication
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment identification

### Rotation Schedules
- GitHub tokens: Every 90 days
- Backup encryption keys: Every 180 days
- Configuration review: Monthly

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checks

### Pre-Commit Validation
```powershell
.\Validate-Configuration.ps1
```
Checks:
- Configuration integrity
- Path safety
- Environment completeness
- Security settings

### Hardcoded Path Detection
```powershell
git ls-files -z | % { 
    $p=$_
    if(Select-String -Path $p -Pattern '([A-Za-z]:\\|/usr/|/home/)' -Quiet){ 
        "$p" 
    }
}
```

### Size and Resource Limits
- Backup size: Configurable per project
- Upload limits: Defined in config.json
- Resource quotas: Per-project basis

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Configuration Files
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use `.env.example` as templates
- Keep secrets in environment variables
- Use secure credential storage

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access where applicable
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Data Protection
- Backup encryption
- Secure deletion procedures
- Data classification guidelines

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Events
1. Unauthorized access attempts
2. Configuration tampering
3. Resource abuse

### Response Steps
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Validate configurations
3. Review audit logs
4. Update security measures
